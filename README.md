# hello-world

(a.k.a. # enter-the-newbie)

I'm Chris. I'm dipping my toes into the world of GitHub and infosec. At the moment, I do not have any meaningful programming knowledge. This is all a bit daunting for me! I've always nourished a strong interest in the messy, huge world of information technology, and increasingly in information security, threats to its security, and the many, many facets that follow and intertwine.  

I'm a victim of too many interests and pursuits: cars (particularly the Volvo 240), bicycles, beer, hiking, reading, parenting, and general home handymanship, to name a few.
